What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power.
	User of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.
	Linux was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.
	It never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you do do anything you tell it to. Anything. Whether it is unintentionally bad or not. That is a huge amount of power in the hands of a user.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	VPS is almost as good as dedicated server but the cost will be cheaper than that. You can have root, choose OS and own app.
  Those feature will not be supported shared server.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	root user is same as administrator. Root user is the only one can do anything. So if you accidentaly remove the directory, allt the information will be deleted. If you are the only operator it will be okay but if you share the server it can be big problem.
