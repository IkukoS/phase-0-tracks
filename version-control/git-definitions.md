# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is management of documents. You can save the changing point with a message. Also you can easily make copies and merge it to the original document when you need. You can keep the copy as a original document if you want. The best part of the version control is you can see your whole process of the document and go back to any saved points if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  Branch is a copy of the master document. Some time we want go back to the document after we made change. If you make branches, you can go back to the point you wants to go back. Also you can cahnge sevral differant things individually from same starting point. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  commit is making a save point. Good commit message should be understandable to anybody so that any programers included you and and somebody you are working with will know what you did at that point when you read the message.

* What is a merge conflict?
 
  When you merge a brach to the master. Git will aoutmatically find the differance between master and branch. Then Git will change the differant part of the master. Sometime the merge does not happen automatically. For exsample, somebody already up dated the master and the master is not same as when you made branch. If git can not figure it out exactlly what your change was. That will turn out as a confilict.
